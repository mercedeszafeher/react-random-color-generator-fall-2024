# React Random Color Generator Fall 2024

Design and develop a random color generator web application using React. This application will show a random color when a button is clicked:

## TODO's:

- [ ] A button with the exact text Generate will cause a new color to be generated when it is clicked
- [ ] Once a color is generated, update the background color of a div which contains the exact text Generated Color: <background color hex code> (the background color and the hex code must match)
      
## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Allow user to specify hue (eg. green or red or blue)
- [ ] Allow user to specify luminosity (eg. light or dark)
- [ ] Transition smoothly between the colors as they change
- [ ] Use a CSS-in-JS library for all styling (eg. Emotion or Styled Components)
- [ ] Allow user to specify size for the color box
- [ ] Make a "screensaver mode" where the color box moves around in a diagonal pattern, bouncing off the screen edges and changing color (eg. like this)
      
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Preflight runs without errors in your project
- [ ] Drone bot has been tagged and responded with a passing message
- [ ] Correct GitHub commit message format (see Writing Commit Messages)
